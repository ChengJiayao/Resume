  <h3>Experience</h3>
  <h4>Institute of Image Communication and Network Engineering, Shanghai     --   2016.12-2017.06</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Participated in Pulmonary Nodule Screening Use Ensembled Deep Neural Networks project</li>
    <li>Use cycle-GAN to expend sample data, training for ensemble three neural network models to get precisely prediction.</li>
    <li>Also participate in an object recognition project that use SURF + RANSAC algorithms, and use pre-trained CNN to
judge the prediction made by this model</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Care Spot Website Development</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Develop a web app to afford better service for Care Spot Android APP.</li
    <li>Designed user interface with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Android App Focus on Find Nursing Room: Care Spot</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Started from set the focus group, do precisely survey, make affinity diagram, then make a prototype with user test</li
    <li>Develop map search app to find nearest nursing room and Handicapped parking space with Android Studio and Java</li>
    <li>This App contains five parts: Map, comment, rate, feedback, chat, with Google Maps sources and SQLite database</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Bias Remove Generative Adversarial Networks</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Built deep learning network to remove bias in a prediction process to avoid dangerous feedback loop effects</li
    <li>Use PyTorch, based on Info-GAN, changed distance function as WGAN-GP</li>
    <li>Add loss function between latent codes and predicted labels to give better constrains to aimed features, add penalty term
to decrease correlations between attributes.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Kaggle Competition: Titanic, Learning from Disaster</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Use Python to build 10 kinds of classic machine learning algorithms and neural networks to get survive predictions.</li
    <li>Employed heuristic data augmentations to increase the invariance and stability of learning network</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Email Management System based on MySQL</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Developed an email management system with MySQL and Node.js for the web and back-end module</li
    <li>Design user interface with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap</li>
  </ul>
